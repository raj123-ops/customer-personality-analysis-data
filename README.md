# customer-personality-analysis-data
This project involved cleaning a marketing dataset by performing the following steps:
 Renamed all column headers to lowercase with underscores for consistency

Checked and removed duplicate rows (none found)

 Handled missing values (none found)

 Standardized text values in categorical columns (already clean)

 Converted dt_customer to proper datetime format (dd-mm-yyyy)

 Verified and corrected data types (e.g., income as float, year_birth as int)
